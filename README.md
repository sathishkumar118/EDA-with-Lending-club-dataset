# Explorartory Data Analysis with Lending club dataset

## Assessing the likelihood of paying back the loan for a peer-to-peer Lending company

### The Data
We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/hadiyad/lendingclub-data-sets

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company.

### Goal

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when the company gets a new potential customer,can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the  loan.

The **"loan_status"** column contains the desired label.
